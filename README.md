# Quick Tetris

Built a quick version of Tetris using html/css/javascript

Inspired by https://github.com/jstimpfle/tetris-on-a-plane/ who built Tetris during a plane ride - I decided to do the same except I set my deadline as the time before I had to start studying for my midterm.

Of course due to time constraints, there are several features missing such as displaying the next block that will drop, a scoring system, and a game over screen. And to add, yes the code is messy but it works!
